				<li><p2>My name is Alice Loveland, and the first thing you should know about me is that I love strawberries! You could probably already tell, though. I am also a Computer Programming student at Columbia College Chicago, in the second semester of my Junior year! I'm also minoring in Creative Writing, which I hope to be able to combine with Computer Programming in order to one day make narrative-driven video games. I'm a tarot card reader and the vice-president of Call of the Cauldron, Columbia's witchcraft club. I'm also a huge nerd, having played video games from a very young age and Dungeons and Dragons for over a decade. I also love roller skating, but don't get as much opportunity for it as I would like. Also, I have an absolutely gorgeous cat named Jester!</p2></li>
