			<p>Alice Loveland (me) is a Computer Programming major at Columbia College Chicago, and also a huge nerd (you probably could've guessed that from 'Computer Programming major'). I was born in Illinois and lived in the south Chicago suburbs until September of 2023, when I upgraded to <strong><em>CITY GIRL STATUS</em></strong>... in other words, I live <em>in</em> Chicago now. I have a deep love of strawberries and their aesthetic, I eat them basically every single day. I have a gorgeous cat named Jester, who is named after a character from Critical Role (a true testament to my nerdiness). I often rollerskate around my apartment for fun, and to motivate myself to do chores! I've played video games as long as I can remember, and I dream of one day combining my love of creative writing with my programming degree in order to create one myself. All in all, if you remember one thing about me, it should probably be that I love strawberries... because I really, really love strawberries.</p>
