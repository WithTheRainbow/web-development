			<p>I found it incredibly interesting to learn about the evolution of the internet and its websites, especially through a firsthand account. However, I found it even more remarkable to learn about how this evolution was deeply rooted in and fostered by capitalism. I hadn't before considered how web design was monopolized and standardized, essentially stripping it of artistic freedom and expression. Personally, I think it's a great shame to hear of how much of this "1.0" era is forever lost to time, especially considering I never got to experience it for myself. But I <em>am</em> glad to hear that at least a portion of it was archived, affording me the opportunity to explore at least some of such a unique part of the internet's history.</p>
			<p>Wagner goes on to talk about how nostalgia for the early internet is preyed on by capitalism, which absorbs it into media and product marketing. She particularly talks about the visual aesthetics of vaporwave, explaining that "The pastiche compositions of Arizona Iced Tea cans and old Windows desktops were very quickly made available on all these commercial interfaces, which were not only feeding on a countercultural art movement&#150they were likewise consuming the ghosts of an internet they had long since murdered. The critique offered by vaporwave&#150its defiant sense of utopia&#150was immediately and effectively erased, leaving only a commodified, nostalgic aesthetic." This immediately reminded me of the way foreign names have often been anglicized, bastardizing part of a culture primarily for the sake of serving those who are already more privileged. But it also got me thinking about just how much nostalgia is preyed on nowadays. Disney remakes, spinoffs focused on popular characters, mascot horror, video game ports and remakes, and new sequels to movies from over a decade ago are just some of the examples I can think of off the top of my head.
<p>It's almost astounding to me just how much it feels like new ideas are becoming more scarce, as focus nowadays seems to shift towards revitalizing the old ones, taking advantage of the human desire for the familiar. Animated movies had become enamored with the Pixar style until only recently, when more creative movies such as Into the Spiderverse and Puss in Boots: The Last Wish came out, and I'm delighted to see that those movies have been so highly acclaimed and are being rewarded for their innovation. However, even those movies heavily take advantage of nostalgia, and I suspect that if they didn't, they wouldn't have become nearly as successful as they did.
			<p>And all of that feels to me like what Wagner is talking about here: "We didn't know it at the time, but the cluttered facade of Myspace pages would be the dying gasp of a natively vernacular web aesthetic, one defined by a lack of restriction on what the page could or should look like. Such a degree of customization is extremely rare today (though it does manage to persist through revivalist websites like Neocities and desktop&#150only customized Tumblr themes)." Social media now has strict, consistent layouts and very little page customization, usually limited to profile pictures and banners. It, too, takes advantage of the human desire for the familiar, killing off that which is more artistically free. I recall a long time ago when YouTube channels could have custom profile backgrounds and colors, features which were removed in favor of, you guessed it, consistent, uncustomizable layouts. I never understood these changes until I read this article. I think it's truly a shame how much capitalism has and continues to stamp out artistic expression.
