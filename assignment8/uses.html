				<img src="img/strawberryItems.jpg" alt="A collection of strawberry themed items. There are two cups, a chocolate-covered strawberry-shaped stress ball, a strawberry jewelry travel bag, and a small knitted strawberry coin purse. All of this is atop my strawberry bedsheets.">
				<p>Behold, a small sample of the strawberry themed items in my home. Gaze upon them and bask in their charm!</p>

				<img src="img/wallflower20.jpg" alt="Spread love. Through sweetness. Through comfort. Bring peace. Bring refreshment. Encourage health. Encourage spirit. My heart in the palm of your hand. Spread love.">
				<p>Strawberries are great inspiration for your own artistic endeavors! Here's a poem I wrote about them.</p>

				<h5>SUBJECT OF CULINARY CHEMISTRY</h5>
				<img src="img/strawberryCrepe.jpg" alt="A very close up picture I took of a strawberry crepe.">
				<p>Also known in layman's terms as "baking," culinary chemistry has few ingredients as delicious as strawberries! You can make all kinds of sweets such as pies, cakes, turnovers, and more! They're good covered in chocolate, they're good atop a stack of pancakes... There's just no way you can go wrong!</p>

				<img src="img/strawberryBrand.jpg" alt="A picture of me, Alice Loveland, in most of my strawberry themed outfit. Yes, that's right, *most* of. Unfortunately this picture is from when I still had ugly glasses.">
				<p>Need something to base your entire identity, personality, and personal brand off of? Look no further! I've had friends, family, and even professors tell me that when they see strawberries, they think of me now. I've wormed my way into their psyche during their daily lives like a jingle for a flooring company.</p>
